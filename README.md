# Professional README Generator

## Description

This application is designed to generate a professional-looking README.md file. This is a useful tool for quickly creating a well-organized and thorough README that will be an asset to one's application. By answering questions, each section of the README is filled out, streamlining the creation process by prompting the user to answer pertinent questions.

### Works Cited

To complete this project, I got help from my tutor, Marc Calache, I referenced the course work, specifically Module 9, Lessons 1-3, and I referenced https://choosealicense.com/ to help select options for licenses. I also used lukas-h's license-badges.md badges for the linked license badge. Their GitHub repository link is https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba.
